# Profile Persistence Fix Summary

## Issue
Profiles were being created successfully but were deleted on app reload/refresh.

## Root Causes
1. Zustand's persist middleware was passing objects to the storage adapter, but the custom storage adapter was expecting strings
2. During rehydration, Zustand was only loading the default profile instead of all profiles from localStorage
3. The initial store state was starting with an empty array, which was triggering the creation of only the default profile

## Final Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Custom Storage Adapter
Modified `customProfileStorage.ts` to handle both string and object values:
```typescript
setItem: (name: string, value: string | any): void => {
  // Handle both string and object values (Zustand sometimes passes objects)
  let stringValue: string;
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    stringValue = value;
  } else {
    try {
      stringValue = JSON.stringify(value);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[CustomStorage] Failed to stringify value:', error);
      return;
    }
  }
  
  localStorage.setItem(name, stringValue);
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Rehydration Logic
Updated the `onRehydrateStorage` callback in `profile.store.ts` to check localStorage directly and ensure all profiles are loaded:
```typescript
onRehydrateStorage: () => {
  return (state, error) => {
    if (error || !state) return;
    
    // Check localStorage directly to ensure we have all profiles
    const stored = localStorage.getItem('grid-profile-storage');
    if (stored) {
      try {
        const parsed = JSON.parse(stored);
        const storedProfiles = parsed.state?.profiles || [];
        
        // If localStorage has more profiles, use those
        if (storedProfiles.length > state.profiles.length) {
          state.profiles = storedProfiles;
          state.activeProfileId = parsed.state?.activeProfileId || storedProfiles[0].id;
        }
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('[ProfileStore] Error checking localStorage during rehydration:', e);
      }
    }
    
    // Mark as hydrated and ensure default profile exists
    state.setHasHydrated(true);
  };
}
```

### 3. Store Initialization Fix
Changed initial state to include default profile to prevent empty state:
```typescript
profiles: [createDefaultProfile()],  // Start with default profile to prevent empty state
```

## Result
Profiles now persist correctly across page reloads. The store properly hydrates with all profiles from localStorage instead of just the default profile.
