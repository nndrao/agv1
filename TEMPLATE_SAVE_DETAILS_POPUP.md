# Template Save Details Popup Implementation

## Overview
Added a popup dialog that displays detailed information about what was saved when a user clicks the "Save Template" button in the Save Column Template dialog.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New State Variables
```typescript
const [showDetailsDialog, setShowDetailsDialog] = useState(false);
const [savedTemplateDetails, setSavedTemplateDetails] = useState<{
  templateInfo: any;
  savedSettings: any;
  localStorage: any;
} | null>(null);
```

### 2. Modified handleSaveTemplate Function
- Captures the template ID returned from `saveTemplate()`
- Retrieves the saved template from the store
- Gets localStorage data to show persistence
- Prepares detailed information for display
- Shows the details dialog after saving

### 3. Added Template Details Dialog
The dialog displays:
- **Template Information**: ID, name, description, creation time, included properties
- **Saved Settings**: The actual JSON of settings that were saved
- **LocalStorage Persistence**: Storage key, total templates count, and the full template object
- **Profile Settings Note**: Explains that templates are independent of profiles

## What Users See

When clicking "Save Template", users will now see:

1. A popup showing exactly what was saved in JSON format
2. The template ID that was generated
3. What settings were included (filtered for formatting only)
4. How it's stored in localStorage
5. Information about the relationship between templates and profiles

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what data is being saved
2. **Debugging**: Helps developers and users troubleshoot template issues
3. **Education**: Users understand what templates contain
4. **Verification**: Users can verify their settings were saved correctly

## Technical Details

The popup shows:
- Template metadata (ID, name, description, timestamp)
- The filtered settings object (excluding column identity and state properties)
- LocalStorage information including the storage key and total template count
- The complete template object as stored in localStorage

This implementation maintains the existing functionality while adding visibility into the save process.
