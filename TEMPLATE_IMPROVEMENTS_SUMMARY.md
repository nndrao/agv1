# Template Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Templates Only Applying to One Column
- **Problem**: Templates were only applying to the first selected column, even when multiple columns were selected
- **Root Cause**: `ColumnFormattingDialog` was only passing the first selected column as `targetColumn`
- **Fix**: 
  - Modified `ColumnFormattingDialog.tsx` to not pass any targetColumn
  - Updated `useRibbonState.ts` to preserve existing column selections

### 2. Limited Template Properties
- **Problem**: Templates were only saving a small subset of column properties
- **Fix**: Expanded available properties to include all configurable options:
  - General: headerName, type, width, minWidth, maxWidth, hide, pinned, sortable, resizable, lockPosition, lockVisible
  - Styling: cellClass, cellStyle, headerClass, headerStyle, wrapText, autoHeight, wrapHeaderText, autoHeaderHeight
  - Format: valueFormatter
  - Filter: filter, filterParams, floatingFilter, suppressHeaderMenuButton, suppressFiltersToolPanel
  - Editor: editable, cellEditor, cellEditorParams, singleClickEdit, cellEditorPopup

### 3. Function-based Properties Not Saved
- **Problem**: Properties like cellStyle, headerStyle, and valueFormatter (which are functions) couldn't be serialized
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced `getCurrentSettings()` to extract and serialize function-based properties
  - Updated `applyTemplate()` to restore functions from serialized format
  - Special handling for:
    - `cellStyle`: Extracts base style from functions
    - `headerStyle`: Saves styles for both regular and floating headers
    - `valueFormatter`: Preserves format strings

## Enhanced Default Templates

Updated all default templates to include comprehensive settings:
1. **Currency Format**: Includes styling, formatting, filtering, sizing, and editing
2. **Percentage Format**: Center-aligned with number editor
3. **Date Format**: Includes date picker and comparator
4. **Editable Text**: Single-click edit with text filters
5. **Read-only Locked**: Pinned left with gray background
6. **Wrapped Text**: Large text editor with auto-height
7. **Numeric Column**: Right-aligned with number filters

## How Templates Now Work

1. **Saving Templates**:
   - Captures ALL modified properties from selected columns
   - Properly serializes function-based properties
   - Stores configuration that can be restored later

2. **Applying Templates**:
   - Applies to ALL selected columns (not just one)
   - Restores function-based properties correctly
   - Preserves all styling, formatting, and behavior settings

3. **Property Selection**:
   - Shows which properties have been modified (blue highlight)
   - Allows selective saving of only desired properties
   - Quick buttons for "Modified Only" and "Select All"

## Testing

To verify the improvements:
1. Select multiple columns in the grid
2. Apply various settings (styles, formats, filters, etc.)
3. Save as a template
4. Select different columns
5. Apply the saved template
6. All selected columns should receive ALL the saved properties
