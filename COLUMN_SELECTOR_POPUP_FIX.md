# Column Selector Popup Fix

## Problem
The customization count indicator in the column selector table wasn't clickable - clicking it didn't bring up a popup to view or manage customizations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Made Customization Indicator Clickable
- Converted the static div to a button wrapped in a Popover component
- Added `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to prevent row selection when clicking the indicator
- Added hover effect (`hover:bg-primary/20`) to indicate interactivity
- Added `cursor-pointer` class for proper cursor styling

### 2. Created CustomizationDetails Component
A new component that displays all customizations for a column:

```tsx
const CustomizationDetails: React.FC<{ columnId: string; columnDef: ColDef }>
```

Features:
- Shows all customization types with appropriate icons:
  - **Styling** (Palette icon): Cell/header styles and classes
  - **Formatter** (Hash icon): Value formatters
  - **Filter** (Filter icon): Filter type and params
  - **Editor** (Edit3 icon): Cell editors and params
  - **General** (Settings icon): Width, pinned status, position lock
  - **Template** (Move icon): Applied template name

### 3. Added Delete Functionality
- Each customization type shows a delete button (X icon) on hover
- Clicking the delete button removes all related customizations for that type
- Uses the store's `removeColumnCustomization` method for proper state management
- Handles template removal separately with `removeAppliedTemplate`

### 4. UI Improvements
- Added `min-w-[200px]` to prevent the popup from being too narrow
- Used `group` and `group-hover` classes for hover-based delete button visibility
- Delete button styled with destructive color (`text-destructive`)
- Proper spacing and layout for readability

## Technical Details

### Store Integration
Uses these store methods:
- `removeColumnCustomization(columnId, type)` - Removes customizations by type
- `removeAppliedTemplate(columnId)` - Removes applied template

### Customization Types Mapping
- 'Styling' → 'style'
- 'Formatter' → 'formatter'
- 'Filter' → 'filter'
- 'Editor' → 'editor'
- 'General' → 'general'
- 'Template' → handled separately

### Accessibility
- Added `aria-label` to both the indicator button and delete buttons
- Used semantic button elements for keyboard navigation
- Proper focus management with popover

## Result
Users can now:
1. Click on the customization count indicator to see details
2. View all customizations applied to a column
3. Remove individual customization types with a single click
4. See immediate visual feedback when hovering over removable items
