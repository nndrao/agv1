# Fixed Warnings Summary

## 1. Fixed modulepreload warning
- **Issue**: Empty `<link rel="modulepreload">` tag without href
- **Location**: `/index.html` line 103-107
- **Fix**: Removed the unnecessary modulepreload code since AG-Grid is already bundled by Vite

## 2. Fixed AG-Grid invalid colDef properties
- **Issue**: `display` and `alignItems` were being set as column properties
- **Location**: `/src/components/datatable/utils/constants.ts`
- **Fix**: Removed these CSS properties from DEFAULT_COLUMN_PROPERTIES

## 3. Multi-filter display property
- **Note**: The `display` property in FilterCustomContent is correctly used within `filterParams` for multi-filter configuration, not as a direct column property. This is valid AG-Grid usage.

## Result
All warnings should now be resolved:
- ✅ No more modulepreload warnings
- ✅ No more invalid colDef property warnings
- ✅ Profiles are now saving correctly to localStorage

The application should run cleanly without these console warnings.
