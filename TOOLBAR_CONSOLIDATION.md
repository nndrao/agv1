# Toolbar Consolidation Summary

## Overview
The DataTable toolbar has been significantly simplified by consolidating multiple UI elements into dropdown menus.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Export Buttons
- Removed Excel export button
- Removed CSV export button
- Removed associated export functions and imports

### 2. Created Settings Dropdown (Left Side)
Combined profile management and font settings into a single dropdown:
- **Profile Selection**: Dropdown to switch between profiles
- **Profile Actions**: Save and New buttons
- **Font Family**: Selector for monospace fonts
- **Font Size**: Selector for font sizes

The dropdown button shows the current profile name and uses a User icon.

### 3. Created Options Dropdown (Right Side)
Moved all grid configuration options into a dropdown menu:
- Data Source
- Grid Options
- Customize Columns

The dropdown uses a "more" (three dots) icon.

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Interface**: Reduced toolbar clutter significantly
2. **Logical Grouping**: Related functions are grouped together
3. **Better Mobile Experience**: More compact toolbar works better on smaller screens
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add more options without cluttering the toolbar

## Current Toolbar Layout
```
[Profile/Settings Dropdown] | [Options Dropdown â‹®]
```

The toolbar now only shows two dropdown buttons, making it much cleaner and more professional.
