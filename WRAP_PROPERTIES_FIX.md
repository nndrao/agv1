# Text Wrap and Auto Height Properties Fix

## Issue
The text wrap and auto height properties (`wrapText`, `autoHeight`, `wrapHeaderText`, `autoHeaderHeight`) were not being saved in templates.

## Root Causes
1. These boolean properties might be `undefined` in the column definition, which was causing them to be skipped
2. Properties set before opening the dialog weren't being detected as "modified"
3. The properties needed explicit handling to ensure `false` values are saved

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced `getCurrentSettings()` 
- Now explicitly checks for wrap properties and sets them to `false` if undefined
- Ensures all four wrap properties are always included in the settings object

### 2. Improved `getModifiedProperties()`
- Now checks both `pendingChanges` AND the original `columnDefinitions`
- Specifically looks for wrap properties that are set to `true` in the column definition
- This ensures properties set before opening the dialog are detected

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Added console logs to help debug template saving and application
- Logs show which properties are being saved and their values

## Properties Now Properly Saved
- `wrapText` - Enable/disable text wrapping in cells
- `autoHeight` - Auto-adjust row height based on content
- `wrapHeaderText` - Enable/disable text wrapping in headers
- `autoHeaderHeight` - Auto-adjust header height based on content

## How It Works Now
1. When saving a template, all wrap properties are captured (even if `false`)
2. The "Modified Only" button will highlight wrap properties if they're `true`
3. Templates will save and restore these properties correctly
4. Boolean `false` values are preserved and applied

## Testing
1. Set wrap text and auto height for cells/headers
2. Save as a template
3. Apply to different columns
4. The wrap settings should be preserved
