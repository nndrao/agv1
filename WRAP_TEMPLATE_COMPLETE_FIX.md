# Complete Fix for Wrap Text and Auto Height in Templates

## Root Cause
The wrap properties (`wrapText`, `autoHeight`, `wrapHeaderText`, `autoHeaderHeight`) were not being saved in templates because:
1. Users weren't selecting them in the template save dialog
2. The properties weren't being highlighted as "modified" if set before opening the dialog
3. No visual indication that these properties were enabled

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Property Detection
- Modified `getModifiedProperties()` to check both `pendingChanges` AND `columnDefinitions`
- Wrap properties with `true` values are now automatically detected as "modified"
- This ensures they appear with blue highlighting in the property list

### 2. Improved Property Saving
- `getCurrentSettings()` now explicitly includes all wrap properties
- Defaults to `false` if undefined to ensure they're always available
- Added explicit handling to ensure wrap properties are included in processed settings

### 3. Enhanced UI Feedback
- Wrap properties that are ON now show:
  - Green text with a checkmark (✓)
  - Green dot indicator
  - Green ring around the property
  - Tooltip showing "Currently: ON"
- Modified properties show blue highlighting
- This makes it clear which properties should be selected

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
- Added detailed console logging throughout the flow
- Helps debug exactly what's being saved and applied

## How It Works Now

1. **When Saving a Template**:
   - Toggle wrap/auto-height in Styling tab
   - Open "Save Template" dialog
   - Wrap properties that are ON will be:
     - Highlighted in green with ✓
     - Pre-selected if using "Modified Only" button
   - Select the properties you want to include
   - Save the template

2. **When Applying a Template**:
   - Select target columns
   - Apply template
   - All selected properties (including wrap) will be applied

## Visual Indicators in Save Dialog
- **Blue background + Blue dot**: Modified property
- **Green text + Green dot + ✓**: Wrap property that is ON
- **Tooltip**: Shows current state (ON/OFF) for wrap properties

## Important Note
Users MUST select the wrap properties in the save dialog for them to be included in the template. The visual indicators now make it clear which properties are enabled and should be selected.
