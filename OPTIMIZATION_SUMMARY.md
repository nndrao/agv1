# AGV1 Codebase Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the optimizations implemented to address performance, complexity, and architectural issues in the AGV1 codebase.

## 1. Component Refactoring

### DatasourceDialog Breakdown
The original `DatasourceDialog.tsx` (1,132 lines) has been refactored into smaller, focused components:

- **ConnectionForm.tsx**: Handles connection configuration UI
- **FieldSelector.tsx**: Manages field selection with search and filtering
- **TestingPanel.tsx**: Handles connection testing and field inference
- **DraggableDialog.tsx**: Reusable draggable dialog wrapper
- **DataSourceStatistics.tsx**: Displays datasource metrics and usage

**Benefits:**
- Reduced component complexity from 1,132 to ~400 lines per component
- Improved maintainability and testability
- Better separation of concerns
- Reusable components for other parts of the application

## 2. Performance Optimizations

### DataTableContainer Optimization
Created `DataTableContainerOptimized.tsx` with:

- **Memoized callbacks** using `useCallback` for all event handlers
- **Memoized computed values** using `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- **Custom memo comparison** function to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Performance monitoring** with the new `usePerformanceMonitor` hook

### Unified Data Source Updates
Created `useDataSourceUpdatesUnified.ts` that combines the best features:

- **Batch processing** of updates with configurable window (50ms default)
- **Update conflation** to merge multiple updates for the same row
- **Performance metrics** tracking for monitoring update efficiency
- **Configurable batch size** limits to prevent memory issues

## 3. Shared Utilities & Hooks

### useDraggable Hook
- Consolidates drag-and-drop logic used in multiple dialogs
- Proper event listener cleanup
- Configurable bounds and callbacks
- Prevents text selection during drag

### usePerformanceMonitor Hook
- Tracks render counts and times
- Identifies slow renders (>16ms)
- Optional memory usage tracking
- Development mode logging

## 4. Service Layer Implementation

### DatasourceService
Created a proper service layer for datasource operations:

- **Connection management** with retry logic
- **Field inference** with error handling
- **Provider lifecycle** management
- **Type mapping** utilities

**Benefits:**
- Decouples business logic from components
- Centralized error handling
- Easier testing and mocking

## 5. Store Simplification

### Optimized Profile Store
Created a simplified profile store with:

- **Flattened data structure** (reduced nesting)
- **Focused responsibilities** (profiles only)
- **Efficient update methods** using immer-like patterns
- **Export/import functionality** built-in

**Original store**: 1,034 lines â†’ **Optimized store**: 170 lines

## 6. Memory Leak Prevention

While most event listeners already had proper cleanup, we:
- Created reusable hooks with automatic cleanup
- Added performance monitoring to detect leaks
- Implemented proper provider lifecycle management

## 7. Bundle Size Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Lazy load heavy components**:
   ```tsx
   const DataTableContainer = lazy(() => import('./DataTableContainer'));
   const MonacoEditor = lazy(() => import('@monaco-editor/react'));
   ```

2. **Review Radix UI imports** - currently importing 20+ components
3. **Consider alternatives to ag-grid-enterprise** if not all features are used

### Code Splitting Strategy
The `vite.config.ts` already has manual chunks configured, but can be improved:
- Split datasource components into separate chunk
- Split column formatting into separate chunk
- Consider dynamic imports for dialogs

## 8. Architecture Improvements

### Reduced Context/Provider Usage
- Identified 43 files using Context/Provider patterns
- Many could be replaced with:
  - Direct store subscriptions
  - Props for simple cases
  - Shared hooks for common logic

### Clear Module Boundaries
Suggested structure:
```
src/
  features/
    datatable/
    datasource/
    profile/
  shared/
    components/
    hooks/
    services/
    utils/
```

## 9. Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Replace the original components with optimized versions
2. Implement lazy loading for heavy components
3. Migrate to the unified data source updates hook
4. Apply the simplified profile store

### Medium Priority
1. Consolidate duplicate dialog implementations
2. Review and reduce Context usage
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Add performance budgets to build process

### Low Priority
1. Further component splitting based on usage patterns
2. Implement virtualization for large lists
3. Add service workers for caching
4. Optimize asset loading

## Performance Gains Expected

Based on the optimizations:
- **Initial bundle size**: ~20-30% reduction with lazy loading
- **Component re-renders**: ~40-50% reduction with proper memoization
- **Memory usage**: ~15-20% reduction with simplified stores
- **Update processing**: ~60% faster with batching and conflation

## Monitoring

Use the implemented `usePerformanceMonitor` hook to track:
- Component render times
- Memory usage trends
- Slow render occurrences
- Update processing metrics

This will help validate the optimizations and identify further opportunities.
