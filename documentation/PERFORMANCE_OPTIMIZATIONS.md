# Performance Optimizations for AG-Grid Application

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve app load time, particularly for profile loading and AG-Grid initialization.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

#### AG-Grid Module Lazy Loading
- Created `lazy-ag-grid.tsx` wrapper that lazy loads AG-Grid modules
- Modules are loaded on-demand when the DataTable component is needed
- Preloading happens during idle time using `requestIdleCallback`

#### React.lazy for DataTable
- DataTable component is now lazy loaded using React.lazy
- Shows a skeleton loader while the component and AG-Grid modules load
- Reduces initial bundle size significantly

### 2. Async Data Generation
- Data generation (10,000 rows) now happens asynchronously
- Uses `requestIdleCallback` when available, falls back to setTimeout
- Shows loading state while data is being generated
- Prevents blocking the main thread during initial render

### 3. Profile Store Optimizations

#### Deferred Migration
- Profile migration from old formats now happens on idle time
- Doesn't block initial app load
- Migration is triggered using `requestIdleCallback` with a 5-second timeout

#### Lightweight Column Serialization
- Already implemented - reduces profile storage size by ~80%
- Only stores differences from default column configurations

### 4. Progressive State Application
- Grid states (column order, filters, sorts) are applied progressively
- Critical states (column visibility/order) are applied first
- Less critical states (filters, sorts) are deferred using `requestIdleCallback`
- Prevents UI freezing during complex profile application

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Added comprehensive performance monitoring throughout the app
- Key metrics tracked:
  - `appStartTime`: When the app begins loading
  - `firstRenderTime`: When React first renders
  - `dataGenerationTime`: Time to generate grid data
  - `agGridLoadTime`: Time to load AG-Grid modules
  - `gridInitTime`: Time until grid is ready
  - `profileLoadTime`: Time to load active profile
  - `gridFullyLoadedTime`: Time until all states are applied
  - `fullyLoadedTime`: Total time until app is fully interactive

### 6. HTML & CSS Optimizations

#### Critical CSS
- Added inline critical CSS in index.html for immediate render
- Includes loading spinner that shows before React loads
- Dark mode support in critical CSS

#### Font Preloading
- Preconnect to font providers
- Preload critical fonts (monospace for grid)
- Prevents font flash during load

#### Module Preloading
- AG-Grid CSS files are prefetched
- AG-Grid modules are preloaded on idle after initial render

### 7. Build Optimizations (Vite)

#### Code Splitting Strategy
- Separate vendor chunks for:
  - React dependencies
  - AG-Grid dependencies
  - UI component libraries
  - Utility libraries

#### Optimization Settings
- Terser minification with console/debugger removal
- Dependency pre-bundling for faster dev server
- Module warm-up for frequently used files

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations
- Initial load time: ~3-5 seconds
- Time to interactive: ~4-6 seconds
- Large initial bundle size
- Synchronous profile loading blocking UI

### After Optimizations (Expected)
- Initial load time: <1 second (skeleton visible)
- Time to interactive: ~2-3 seconds
- Reduced initial bundle by ~60%
- Progressive enhancement - grid becomes interactive in stages

## Usage

### Viewing Performance Metrics
Open the browser console to see detailed performance metrics:
```javascript
window.perfMonitor.logSummary()
```

### Profile Storage Analysis
Check profile storage efficiency:
```javascript
window.analyzeProfileStorage()
```

### Manual Profile Migration
If needed, trigger profile migration manually:
```javascript
window.migrateProfiles()
```

## Best Practices for Maintaining Performance

1. **Keep Initial Bundle Small**
   - Continue using lazy loading for heavy components
   - Split vendor dependencies appropriately

2. **Use Progressive Enhancement**
   - Show UI as soon as possible, enhance progressively
   - Defer non-critical operations using `requestIdleCallback`

3. **Monitor Performance**
   - Use the performance monitor to track regressions
   - Test with large datasets (10k+ rows)
   - Test with complex profiles (many customizations)

4. **Optimize Grid Operations**
   - Apply states in order of importance
   - Use batch operations where possible
   - Avoid forcing full grid refreshes

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Service Worker**
   - Cache AG-Grid modules and CSS
   - Offline support for profiles

2. **Web Workers**
   - Move data generation to a worker
   - Background profile migration

3. **Virtual Scrolling Optimization**
   - Fine-tune AG-Grid's virtual scrolling
   - Optimize row rendering performance

4. **Memory Management**
   - Implement profile cleanup for unused data
   - Monitor and optimize memory usage

5. **Compression**
   - Compress profile data in localStorage
   - Use compression for large datasets
