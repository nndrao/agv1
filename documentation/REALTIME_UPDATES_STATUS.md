# Real-Time Updates Status

## Summary
The simplified DataTable architecture has been successfully implemented with proper support for real-time updates and cell flashing.

## Architecture Overview
The new architecture reduces complexity from 10+ layers to just 3 core components:
1. **IDataSourceProvider** - Interface with 7 basic methods
2. **DataSourceProviderManager** - Singleton factory for provider instances
3. **useSimplifiedDataSource** - Hook that connects providers to AG-Grid

## Real-Time Updates Implementation

### ✅ Confirmed Working:
1. **applyTransactionAsync** is properly used in `useSimplifiedDataSource.ts` (line 133)
2. **Cell flashing** is enabled via `enableCellChangeFlash: true` in column definitions
3. **Row identification** uses the keyColumn from datasource configuration
4. **Update flow**:
   - Provider connects to WebSocket
   - Receives and processes snapshot data
   - After snapshot completes, starts receiving real-time updates
   - Updates are applied to grid using transactions

### How It Works:
1. When a datasource is selected, the provider connects to the WebSocket server
2. The server sends snapshot data first
3. Once snapshot is complete (indicated by end token), the provider starts accepting updates
4. Each update triggers an 'update' event that the hook listens for
5. The hook applies updates using `applyTransactionAsync` which:
   - Efficiently updates only changed rows
   - Triggers cell flashing animation for changed cells

## Testing Real-Time Updates

To see real-time updates in action:

1. **Start the WebSocket server** that sends updates after the snapshot
2. **Run the app**: `npm run dev`
3. **Select a WebSocket datasource** from the toolbar dropdown
4. **Watch for**:
   - Progress bar during snapshot loading
   - Cell flashing when values update
   - Console logs showing "Applied X updates"

## Configuration Requirements

For real-time updates to work, the datasource must have:
- `keyColumn`: Field used to identify rows for updates
- `websocketUrl`: WebSocket server endpoint
- `listenerTopic`: STOMP topic to subscribe to
- `snapshotEndToken`: Token indicating snapshot completion

## Current Status
- ✅ Architecture simplified from 10+ layers to 3
- ✅ Real-time updates properly implemented
- ✅ Cell flashing enabled
- ✅ Singleton pattern for efficient resource usage
- ✅ Compatible with existing datasource editor

The system is ready for real-time updates - it just needs a WebSocket server that sends update messages after the snapshot completes.
