# Profile Structure Fix Summary

## Issue
Column settings were being lost when:
1. Apply button clicked in gridOptions editor
2. Save profile button clicked  
3. App reloads

## Root Cause
The GridOptionsPropertyEditor and useGridCallbacks were trying to read `gridOptions` from the wrong location in the profile structure:
- ❌ Was reading from: `activeProfile?.gridState?.gridOptions`
- ✅ Should read from: `activeProfile?.gridOptions`

This was a leftover from the old structure before we separated the profile into three distinct properties.

## Fix Applied

### 1. GridOptionsPropertyEditor.tsx
Fixed 4 locations where it was reading from the wrong path:
- Line 58: Initialize local options
- Line 66: Track changes
- Line 140: Handle reset
- Line 199: Pass to GridOptionsPropertyGrid

### 2. useGridCallbacks.ts  
Fixed 2 locations:
- Line 100-119: Apply grid options on grid ready
- Line 122-124: Apply font from grid options

## New Profile Structure
```typescript
export interface GridProfile {
  // Column customizations (styles, formatters, etc)
  columnSettings?: {
    columnCustomizations?: Record<string, ColumnCustomization>;
    baseColumnDefs?: ColDef[];
  };
  
  // AG-Grid state (column state, filters, sorts)
  gridState?: {
    columnState?: ColumnState[];
    filterModel?: FilterModel;
    sortModel?: SortModelItem[];
  };
  
  // Grid options (row height, header height, etc)
  gridOptions?: GridOptionsConfig & { font?: string };
}
```

## Testing
1. Open the app and create/select a profile
2. Apply grid options (change row height, etc)
3. Apply column customizations (cell styles, formatters)
4. Save the profile
5. Reload the page
6. Verify both grid options and column customizations are preserved

Use the test script in `test-profile-fix.js` to verify the localStorage structure.
